# notes/_private (local-only)
This folder is **intentionally gitignored**. Use it for anything that should not be committed:

- credentials / tokens / PATs
- partner contacts, emails, introductions
- raw dumps or large working files you don't want in git
- scratchpad outputs during consolidation

Policy:
- Anything in `notes/_private/` is local-only.
- Canonical governance + manifests live in `notes/_org/` (tracked).
- When something becomes shareable/releasable, promote it out of `_private` into the appropriate tracked location.
