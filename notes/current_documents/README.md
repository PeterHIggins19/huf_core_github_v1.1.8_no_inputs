# Current Documents (Draft Lane)
This directory is the intake and staging area for all new documents (DOCX/PDF/MD dumps).

Workflow
- INBOX: drop raw documents here: `inbox/YYYY-MM/`
- STAGED: assign Doc ID and apply two-line header: `staged/<DOC_ID>/`
- RELEASE: move to canonical path only when reviewed/release-ready
- LEGACY: never delete; mark deprecated with superseded_by

Rule
If it lacks a Doc ID + header, it is INBOX and not canonical.
