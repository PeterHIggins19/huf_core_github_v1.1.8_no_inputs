1 - First dispersal	Grok	Croatia site data verification + mathematical elaborations (sections 10.16-10.24)	0.15	Retained â€” citations only	RSIS site data table	Useful data layer. Narrative sections discarded. Grok pattern confirmed: scope lock required.
1 - First dispersal	Gemini	Three friction points: normalization too abstract / artifact vocabulary alienating / pilot rationale mismatches core problem	0.3	Retained in full	Transboundary gravity framing for Croatia pilot	Highest signal in round 1. Produced the single most important rewrite: EU data portal rationale replaced by ecological governance framing.
1 - First dispersal	ChatGPT	Seven failure points including proposal smell in pilot section	0.3	Retained â€” minimum wording shifts only	Four minimum wording shifts applied to primer	Correctly identified register problem. Shifts: proposedâ†’candidate / would runâ†’can be structured / primary pathwayâ†’potential pathway.
1 - First dispersal	Copilot	Six failure points including cognitive load and first-paragraph abstract framing	0.2	Retained â€” posture diagnosis only	Audience framing guidance	Arrived skeptical. Diagnosis of cognitive load used to restructure artifact vocabulary section.
1 - First dispersal	Claude	Integration and build â€” primer v1â†’v2	0.05	Retained â€” execution only	Primer v2	Integration role. No independent findings this round.
2 - Scientific Operator	Gemini	Black box problem: who sets the weights? Named the missing operator role	0.5	Retained in full	Scientific Operator paragraph added to primer	Single most important structural fix in the entire cycle. One sentence changed the document posture: HUF does not decide â€” your scientific teams do.
2 - Scientific Operator	ChatGPT	Administrative safety: audit framing triggers compliance defensiveness	0.25	Retained â€” reframing only	Subtitle changed: traceability layerâ†’decision-support layer	Correctly flagged audit language as political liability for Secretariat readers.
2 - Scientific Operator	Gemini (round 2)	Async data gap: frozen data assumption will cause scientist to put document down	0.25	Retained in full	Async traceability sentence added to pilot section	Precision without accuracy â€” the phrase that closed the async data argument.
2 - Scientific Operator	Grok	COP14/COP15 elaborations / Fifth Strategic Plan / Freshwater Challenge	0	Discarded â€” off scope	None â€” filed for JAES paper	Useful for academic paper. Not for primer. Discarded with accounting. JAES backlog: Section 2.1.
3 - Inversion	Gemini	Five strongest counter-arguments against HUF adoption	0.4	Retained â€” inverted entirely	Wiki page: What HUF Will Reveal in Your System (first draft)	Operator reframe: these are not flaws in HUF â€” these are the flaws the system presents to HUF.
3 - Inversion	Operator (Peter Higgins)	Inversion instruction: hide nothing / surface all five / if they fix them they fix themselves	1	Retained â€” this is the core posture	Protection line added to primer / wiki page restructured	Not an agent contribution. Operator decision. Recorded here because it changed the framework more than any single agent finding.
3 - Inversion	Gemini	Uncertainty is a regime â€” data age as entropy weight in error budget	0.35	Retained in full	Section 3 of wiki page updated	The line that closed the async data argument permanently.
3 - Inversion	Copilot	Wiki page is accusatory â€” rewrote from you are failing to you gain	0.25	Retained â€” full rewrite accepted	Wiki page: What HUF Will Reveal (final version)	Same five points. Opposite posture. Copilot's rewrite accepted without modification.
4 - Demo design	Gemini	30-minute demonstration choreography + Python wrapper spec + weight-shift simulation	0.6	Retained in full	ramsar_huf_demo.py + food_guide_demo.py	Gemini designed the demo. Claude built and ran it. Clean output confirmed.
4 - Demo design	Claude	Integration â€” built both scripts / ran both / confirmed output matches primer vocabulary	0.4	Retained â€” execution only	Both .py files in demos/	food_guide_demo.py: first real-data demo using public Canada Food Guide data.
5 - Posture pass v5	Grok	Citation risk analysis â€” three findings: CHF figure already removed / 93000 ha needs inline source / endemism correctly hedged. Churned: sections 10.25-10.28 RSIS verification + Neretva discrepancy + transboundary frameworks + Ramsar guidelines	0.2	Retained â€” citation finding only. Churn filed Phase D + JAES	93590 ha RSIS source identified and queued for v6	Grok pattern: question triggered churning. 10.25: 93590 ha confirmed. 10.26: 12742 ha official vs 12922 ha superseded. 10.27: MRC / Nile Basin / La Plata Treaty mapped to HUF. 10.28: Ramsar guidelines vs HUF constructs. All backlogged.
5 - Posture pass v5	Gemini	Section 2 logical tension: tools are good AND tools cannot show this â€” cognitive dissonance for scientist reader	0.4	Retained in full	METT scope framing sentence added to v6	The structural tension no previous pass caught. Resolved with one framing sentence: not a limitation of METT â€” outside its scope.
5 - Posture pass v5	ChatGPT	Section 4 only â€” two phrases in proposal register: the next step is / will be generated	0.25	Retained â€” two word-level shifts	Section 4 shifts applied in v6	Scoped correctly. Same proposal-smell reflex found in v1 still expressing in v5. Both resolved.
5 - Posture pass v5	Copilot	Pass with one caution â€” thirty-minute demonstration phrase reads as action step	0.15	Retained â€” caution overlaps ChatGPT finding	Caution filed â€” addressed in same Section 4 pass	First near-pass from Copilot. Three-sentence verdict as instructed.
5 - Posture pass v5	Claude (sealed)	Primer-to-demo vocabulary gap â€” two output filenames did not match primer vocabulary	0	Retained â€” sealed until all answers returned	Demo script v2: drift_logâ†’portfolio_change_log / discarded_share_recordâ†’coverage_record	Sealed question methodology. Written before any answers received. Not read until all four submitted. Gap confirmed by Gemini in v6 review as independent external verification.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Gemini	v6 confirmed â€” tools tension resolved / demo vocabulary aligned / weight-shift framing noted	0.3	Retained â€” confirmation + convert phrase	v6 GO confirmed	The transition from pitching a tool to offering a diagnostic mirror is complete. Filed as key phrase.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Grok	v6 Section 10.27 â€” clean structural pass â€” note: demo comments reference v4 not v6	0.1	Retained â€” version flag only	Version reference updated in demo script comments	No structural finding on v6. Grok ran old demo in test â€” session artifact not document fault.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	ChatGPT	Full document review (broke scope â€” assigned Section 4 only) â€” four new primer findings + five demo findings	0.35	Retained in full	v8 surgical pass produced: Article 3.2 collapsed / MedWet removed / METT jab identified / Target 15 clarified / funding moved	Broke scope. Findings used anyway. Repo guardian instinct overrode the constraint. Highest-value out-of-scope breach in the cycle.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Copilot	v6 unconditional pass â€” external voice observation â€” produced full Secretariat-register rewrite v6-SR unprompted	0.25	Retained â€” v6-SR accepted as parallel artifact	v6-SR: same claims / same structure / Secretariat-native voice	First unconditional pass from Copilot in entire cycle.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Operator (Peter Higgins)	Reciprocity flip â€” invert the METT jab to validate METT first â€” same ground state principle as the original formula	1	Retained â€” locked before v7 build	METT line flipped: The framework is doing the job METT was never asked to do â†’ METT does exactly what it was designed to do. So does this framework â€” for a different question.	Operator applied the inversion principle from the acoustic ground state. Both Gemini (keep it) and ChatGPT (too much of a jab) verdicts satisfied simultaneously by the flip.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Copilot	v7 synthesis brief â€” produced full v7 text from v6 + v6-SR + Gemini anchors â€” flagged Scientific Operator as internal HUF vocabulary	0.3	Retained â€” one pre-build correction applied	Primer v7 / Scientific Operatorâ†’scientific team's declared priorities	Given synthesis task because it produced both the skeptic pass and the register rewrite. Delivered clean.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Grok	v7 Sections 10.28-10.30 â€” repo scrape / RSIS Python extraction script / EU WFD integration / Neretva RBMP / ARIMA drift elaboration	0	Discarded â€” Phase D and JAES backlog	All sections filed in session transcript	No objection to v7 = implicit GO. Mountain resumed after verdict. RSIS BeautifulSoup + SHA-256 script ready for Phase D.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Gemini	v7 definitive GO â€” four-criteria breakdown all green â€” pre-flight: wiki coherence mapâ†’portfolio share table	0.2	Retained â€” GO + wiki fix queued	GO confirmed	It finally reads like something a Ramsar policy officer could bring into a meeting without risk.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	ChatGPT	v9 surgical pass â€” six micro-edits â€” produced ramsar_contact_primer_v7_surgical_bundle.zip with CHANGELOG	0.35	Retained in full	Primer v8 built directly from surgical docx + CHANGELOG trace	CHANGELOG-driven build. Most traceable single pass in the cycle. Every edit listed by name.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Copilot	v8 pass â€” bidirectional detection property surfaced independently â€” proposed positive-positive sentence without knowing JAES seed existed	0.25	Retained in full	Primer v9: bidirectional sentence added to Section 2	Copilot found the JAES seed through the review process and translated it into plain governance language.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Grok	v9 GO â€” first unconditional GO from Grok in entire cycle â€” one verdict / no elaboration / no sections generated	0.1	Retained â€” confirmation only	GO confirmed	Mountain builder went quiet. Grok silence = signal that document is done.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Gemini	v9 definitive GO â€” four-criteria breakdown â€” the lights are green	0.15	Retained â€” GO confirmed	GO confirmed	The lights are green. The framework is as coherent as it can be without the friction of a live human conversation.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	ChatGPT	v9 conditional GO â€” two credibility hostages: MedWet obligations / verification required	0.3	Retained â€” both fixes applied in v10	Primer v10: obligationsâ†’workflows / verification requiredâ†’clean RSIS cite	Conditional GO held correctly. Full GO on v10. Repo guardian role confirmed across entire cycle.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Operator (Peter Higgins)	Fortress decision â€” publish internally / hold external send / build bastions before any forwarding	1	Retained â€” this is Phase B posture	Four bastion wiki pages + sidebar built	No letter leaves before the bastions are built.
6 - Synthesis v6-v10	Claude	Fortress build â€” merged Claude and ChatGPT bastion versions	0.2	Retained â€” execution only	wiki_ramsar_primer_v10 / wiki_ramsar_scope_boundary / wiki_bastion_b_skeptic_qa / wiki_bastion_c_demo_artifact_trail / wiki_sidebar / wiki_huf_assembly_process / collective_trace_report updated	ChatGPT contributed: safe language policy / evaluation protocol. Claude contributed: version history / phase gates / bidirectional note / artifact trail.
7 - Phase B (PREDICTED)	Gemini	Structural review of bastion pages â€” will probe scope boundary for logical gaps / test whether skeptic Q&A answers are attributable	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: Gemini will find one bastion page that carries the same external-voice texture Copilot found in v6. Likely Bastion B.
7 - Phase B (PREDICTED)	ChatGPT	Bastion page register pass â€” will flag any bastion that sounds like a defense rather than an explanation	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: ChatGPT will find one Q&A answer that still reads defensive. The AI-assisted drafting row is the most likely candidate.
7 - Phase B (PREDICTED)	Copilot	Full collective review of fortress â€” pass/fail verdict on whether the bastions cohere as a system	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: Copilot will pass the bastions but flag one inconsistency between bastion vocabulary and primer v10 vocabulary.
7 - Phase B (PREDICTED)	Grok	Bastion factual verification + RSIS data cross-check against claims in Bastion B and C	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: Grok will verify the 93590 ha figure against live RSIS / check Neretva endemism claim / propose additional rows for the skeptic Q&A from its backlog of Ostrom analogues and WFD integration material.
7 - Phase B (PREDICTED)	Claude	Sealed question for Phase B: does the fortress cohere as a single navigable system or does a reader arriving at any single bastion page feel lost without the others?	TBD	TBD	TBD	Sealed until all Phase B answers received.
8 - Phase C prep (PREDICTED)	ChatGPT	Outreach email draft â€” will produce 2-3 strategic variants with different opening postures	TBD	TBD	TBD	Gemini already offered to run the email through collective review. ChatGPT is the natural drafter. Predicted: one variant will still carry proposal smell on first pass.
8 - Phase C prep (PREDICTED)	Gemini	Email register check â€” will confirm whether the email matches the primer's no-wrong-outcome posture	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: Gemini will find one phrase in the email that implies the contact owes a response.
8 - Phase C prep (PREDICTED)	Copilot	Email pass/fail â€” will check whether the email could be forwarded safely if the contact shares it internally	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: Copilot will pass if the email is written as an opening of a conversation and not as a covering note for a document.
8 - Phase C prep (PREDICTED)	Grok	Subject line and opening sentence analysis â€” will verify no institutional attribution claims in the email body	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: quiet pass if the email is clean. Will generate alternative subject lines if the current one carries any bid register.
9 - Phase D â€” real data (PREDICTED)	Grok	RSIS extraction â€” Croatia 5 sites â€” BeautifulSoup + SHA-256 provenance â€” produces croatia_rsis_export.csv and neretva_ris.pdf	TBD	TBD	cases/ramsar_case/data/raw/croatia_rsis_export.csv + neretva_ris.pdf	Script already written in session 10.28. Activation condition: Phase D gate opens after contact engagement confirmed.
9 - Phase D â€” real data (PREDICTED)	Grok	EU WFD integration â€” RSIS to RBMP data mapping â€” Neretva basin 45 water bodies / 64% good ecological status / 7 dams	TBD	TBD	cases/ramsar_case/docs/wfd_integration_note.md	Section 10.29 material. HUF applied to river basin management plan. Ostrom principle 1: boundary entropy H_b < 0.5.

9 - Phase D â€” real data (PREDICTED)	Claude	Sealed question for Phase D: does the real-data artifact trail match the synthetic demo trail in vocabulary and structure or has drift occurred between the demo and the field run?	TBD	TBD	TBD	Sealed until all Phase D artifacts confirmed.
10 - JAES paper (PREDICTED)	Grok	Full paper scaffold â€” bidirectional flow proof â€” ground state formula derivation â€” isotropic radiation origin â€” inversion chain	TBD	TBD	JAES paper draft Sections 1-4	The dimensionless reciprocal formula. Long dominance and short dominance as the same constraint read from opposite ends. The inversion selects for short dominance. Bidirectional flow holds because the constraint is symmetric.

The unity constraint is the same structural requirement across all four frameworks. HUF operationalizes what they describe.
10 - JAES paper (PREDICTED)	Gemini	Paper structure review â€” will probe whether the acoustic origin of the formula is presented as an analogy or a derivation	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: Gemini will flag any section that implies the wetland and acoustic domains are analogous rather than governed by the same constraint. The distinction is critical for peer review.
10 - JAES paper (PREDICTED)	ChatGPT	Abstract and introduction register pass â€” will ensure the paper does not carry primer vocabulary into academic register	TBD	TBD	TBD	Predicted: ChatGPT will find the word traceability layer in the abstract and flag it as governance vocabulary not journal vocabulary.
10 - JAES paper (PREDICTED)	Operator (Peter Higgins)	Decision on how much of the bidirectional proof to expose in the paper vs. reserve for subsequent work	TBD	TBD	TBD	The full chain of flipping states and the noise elimination property may warrant a separate paper. Operator decision on scope.
