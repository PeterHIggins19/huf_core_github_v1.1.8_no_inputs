    # Long tail (accounting lens)

    **Disambiguation (important):** this is **not** “ML class imbalance.”  
    Here **long tail** means **mass distribution + exception reweighting** — the way a budget, ledger, or log stream becomes *more concentrated* when you filter to exceptions.

    > **Baseline view** (everything) can look stable, while an **exception-only view** becomes sharply concentrated — a few regimes dominate and the review list collapses into a small “top K”.
