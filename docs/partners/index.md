!!! note "Ethics & authorship"
    This page was drafted with AI assistance as an editing and structuring tool. The author reviewed and curated all formal claims; any numerical results shown here are either reproduced by code in this repository or explicitly labeled as illustrative.

## What this page is
A map of where HUF “plugs in” to other systems as a **normalization-invariant audit layer**.

## Why it matters
- You can adopt HUF without rewriting your stack: treat your existing boundaries (tenants, namespaces, tiers, evaluation runs) as **regimes**.
- This makes drift and hidden concentration visible.

## What you’ll see
- Integration notes for vector DBs, frameworks, and evaluation suites.
- Case studies that show the same mechanics in real-ish domains.

## Artifacts / outputs
- Small Python reference runs.
- JSONL traces you can attach to tickets, papers, or audits.

## Run the example
Start with a case study, then compare the same mechanism in an integration page.

## What to expect
You’ll see the same “mass/share” dynamics across very different domains.

## Interpretation
If two domains share the same regime shape, you can reuse your intuition and your tests.

## Next steps
Pick one integration and one case study, run both, then try nesting regimes one level deeper.
