# Vector DB coherence (from retrieval results)

Tip: for quick inspection without notebooks, use the generic artifact inspector:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python scripts/inspect_huf_artifacts.py --out out/vector_db_demo
```

Backward-compatible alias (older docs links):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python scripts/inspect_vector_db_artifacts.py --out out/vector_db_demo
```
