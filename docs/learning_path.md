# Learning Path

If you're new (or not very computer‑savvy), follow this in order:

1. **Start here (no GitHub knowledge required)** → [Get Started (Zero GitHub)](get_started_zero_github.md)  
2. **Understand what HUF is** → [What is the Higgins Unity Framework?](The_Higgins_Unity_Framework.md)  
3. **Run the demos (copy/paste)** → [Quick Run](quick_run.md)  
4. **Developer setup (optional)** → [Start Here (Developer)](start_here.md)  
5. **Download civic data (Markham + Toronto)** → [Data Sources & Fetching](data_sources.md)  
6. **Run cases (examples)** → [Cases](cases.md)  
7. **If something breaks** → [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

## What you’ll end up with

- A working Python virtual environment (`.venv/`)
- Downloaded input files for demos under `cases/*/inputs/`
- Output folders you choose (examples: `out/markham2018`, `out/traffic_phase`)

## Two common beginner mistakes

- **Running commands outside the project folder.**  
  Make sure you are in the folder that contains `pyproject.toml` and `scripts/`.

- **Using a system Python that is not the one you expect.**  
  On Windows, always prefer: `.\.venv\Scripts\python ...` once the venv exists.
